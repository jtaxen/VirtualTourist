# VirtualTourist

This is the fifth of the six projects included in the Udacity iOS Nanodegree program. This project is foucsed on persistence and the Core Data module.

On startup, the user is presented with a map. By holding down and touching a point on the map, a pin appears and the location is stored on the device. When touching this pin, a new view appears. If the location is new, the app sends a request to the Flickr server and downloads a number of photos that are geotagged near the point. These images are stored on the device. The user can then choose to remove some of the images, or remove all of them and download a new batch of photos.
